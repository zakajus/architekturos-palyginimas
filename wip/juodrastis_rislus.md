# Introduction

Following widespread adoption of 8-bit processors in the early 1970s, the years 1978-1985 witnessed a race for 16-bit CPU market dominance, with the Z8000 and  68000 being the flagship designs released by Zilog and Motorola respectively by the year 1979 (Kranenborg). This paper analyzes the architectural differences between these two microprocessors, including design philosophies, layouts, instruction models, applications, and other factors, which resulted in 68000 finding higher relative success in the market than the Z8000.

As their elementary base, both of these CPUs used large-scale integrated circuits, which were already available for commercial use by the mid 1970s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#Large-scale_integration_(LSI)).
